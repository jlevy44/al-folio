**School:** AIS - ALMATY INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL

**EDIT ML Program Track:**
Advanced Research

**About Me:**
Warmest Greetings, My Fellow Dartmouth Medicine EDIT Researchers! My name is Alim Oraz!

Coming from a multicultural and multilingual background, Iâ€™ve persevered through multidimensional adversity to discover my core strengths as a Problem Solver, Helper, and Peacemaker, always supporting all my teammates to succeed together in research projects and in sports as a soccer goalkeeper & captain and as a doubles tennis partner. Pursuing my dual passion for biomedicine/biotech and AI led to my clinical internships at Stanford Medicine and Harvard MEDScienceLAB, as well as hands-on Life Sciences & Biotech research projects with UC San Diego, Boz Life Science Research & Teaching Institute, and Scripps Research Institute in San Diego.

I dedicate myself to helping kids at my local Cerebral Palsy Center and also find time to teach Math Olympiad and Chess skills through my Young Octahedron Minds (YOM) initiative, aspiring to gradually realize my long-term vision to inspire and empower disadvantaged students to pursue STEM careers through an AI-powered, Starlink-connected global STEM education platform.

As a young aspiring scientist, I enjoy observing and experimenting with ant colonies and learning about the ocean dandelion as a communal superorganism. My first research projects range from exploring Nicotinamide Mononucleotide for rescuing human fertility and elderly dysregulation to developing AI/ML Models for Malaria Diagnosis and COVID-19 Genomics. Additionally, I am researching xenotransplantation for growing human organs, and exosome and microbiome biotechnologies for healthspan extension. I am also working to contribute my dual-aspect marine-to-human research to the Bioprocessing Summit and ARDD conferences.

Inspired by my recent MIT BWSI Medlytics studies, I am excited about the mentorship by Professor Levy and Professor Vaickus, and working with their team of experienced mentors, clinicians, research scientists, as well as undergraduate, Master's, MD, PhD, and MD-PhD students. I am committed to progressing from the Advanced Research to Mentor track during my EDIT internships, as all EDIT research projects align perfectly with my dual aspirations for advanced learning and synergistically applying sophisticated research methodologies in biomedicine and AI to benefit real-life patients and help prevent diseases in the first place.

Warmest regards,
Alim Oraz
